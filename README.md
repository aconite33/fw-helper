# fw-helper

[![ci](https://github.com/Wooloomooloo2/fw-helper/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Wooloomooloo2/fw-helper/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Firmware control for the **Framework Laptop 13** on Ubuntu — fan curves, power limits,
battery charge limit, and performance profiles in one tray application.

Inspired by [G-Helper](https://github.com/seerge/g-helper), which does this for ASUS laptops
on Windows. This shares no code with it — see
[ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-separate-repository.md).

> **Status: usable, not yet released.** Fan control, power limits, the battery charge limit
> and profiles all work and are verified on real hardware, driven from a GTK4 window or the
> command line. Fan *curve editing* is still command-line only, and there is no released
> package yet. See [docs/plan.md](docs/plan.md) for what is measured and what is assumed.

## Why

The pieces already exist on Linux — `powercap`, `cros_ec` hwmon, power-profiles-daemon,
`fw-fanctrl` — but they are scattered across sysfs paths, CLIs, and daemons that do not know
about each other. fw-helper is the unifying layer: named profiles that set all of them at
once, switchable from a tray icon or a hotkey.

## What works, honestly

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Live telemetry | **Working** — temps, fan RPM, CPU and whole-machine power, battery life |
| Capability detection | **Working** — every knob reports available, or why not |
| Battery charge limit | **Working** — survives suspend and reboot. Needs a module parameter ([ADR 0008](docs/adr/0008-charge-limit-via-module-parameter.md)) |
| Fan control | **Working** — manual duty or a curve, with every ADR 0006 safety layer verified on hardware |
| Power limits (PL1) | **Working** — a 15 W setpoint held 15.02 W sustained, +0.1% |
| Performance profiles | **Working** — layered over power-profiles-daemon; the GNOME slider stays in sync |
| Custom profiles | **Working** — saved from the app, or written by hand in `/etc/fw-helper/profiles.d/` |
| Fan curve editing | Command line only; no graphical editor yet |
| PL2 (short-term limit) | Not touched — it governs burst response, not sustained thermals |
| **Undervolting** | **Not possible.** See below |

Every mechanism above was exercised on real hardware before any application code was written,
and the measurements are recorded in [docs/hardware-baseline.md](docs/hardware-baseline.md).
Several of them contradicted what the design assumed — the EC's fan curve has ~20 °C of
hysteresis, its duty read-back is quantized to whole percent, and this machine reaches
92.8 °C in ordinary use rather than the 76.8 °C an early test suggested.

### Undervolting is not available

Intel locked the undervolting MSR as the mitigation for
[Plundervolt / CVE-2019-11157](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11157). It is
unreachable on Core Ultra parts and Framework's BIOS does not expose an unlock. This is a
firmware/silicon limitation, not something a Linux application can work around.

Power limits (PL1/PL2) deliver most of what people actually want from undervolting on a
laptop — lower sustained temperatures, quieter fan, longer battery. Measured on this machine:
dropping the sustained limit from 25 W to 15 W took the CPU from **76.8 °C to 64.8 °C** under
full load. See [ADR 0007](docs/adr/0007-no-undervolting.md).

## Hardware support

Developed against:

- Framework Laptop 13 Pro (Intel Core Ultra Series 3), board `FRANMJCP07`, BIOS 03.02
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, kernel 7.0

Other Framework 13 Intel boards will likely work — the daemon probes capabilities at startup
and disables what it cannot drive. AMD boards and the Framework 16 are **not** targeted for
v1; AMD in particular needs a different power-limiting mechanism (`ryzenadj` rather than RAPL).

## Requirements

- A kernel new enough for `cros_ec_hwmon` (fan control)
- power-profiles-daemon (optional but recommended — we integrate with it rather than
  replacing it, so the GNOME power slider keeps working)
- **No `ectool` or `framework_tool` needed** — we use kernel interfaces directly
  ([ADR 0004](docs/adr/0004-sysfs-first-hardware-access.md))

## Safety

Manual fan control is genuinely risky: once userspace takes over, the EC stops managing the
fan and holds the last duty written — so a crashed daemon can leave the fan stuck low under
load. [ADR 0006](docs/adr/0006-fail-safe-fan-control.md) specifies the mitigations
(restore-on-exit, crash-path binary, watchdog, a floor that is never quieter than firmware,
and a critical-temperature override that hands control back unconditionally).

`kill -9` recovery is a release gate, not a nice-to-have. It is measured: EC control was
restored **0.27 s** after the daemon was killed under load.

What the fan floor protects is worth stating precisely, because it changed once the hardware
was measured. The CPU throttles itself at 100 °C, so a fan held too low costs performance
rather than hardware. The component with no protection of its own is the **battery**, whose
sensor reports a 49.9 °C limit — by far the lowest on the board
([ADR 0011](docs/adr/0011-quiet-is-a-legitimate-choice.md)).

## Install

```bash
./scripts/build-deb.sh                   # builds fw-helper_<version>_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./fw-helper_*.deb
```

That installs the daemon, the GTK window (`fw-helper`, also in your app grid) and the CLI,
enables the service, and creates `/etc/fw-helper/profiles.d/` for your own profiles. The
battery charge limit needs one extra opt-in step, because it changes which mechanism governs
charging ([ADR 0008](docs/adr/0008-charge-limit-via-module-parameter.md)):

```bash
sudo fw-helper-enable-charge-control
```

Nothing takes manual control of the fan until you ask it to.

## Or run it from source

```bash
cargo build --all
cargo run -p fw-helperctl -- status      # reads sysfs directly; no daemon needed
```

For the full picture, run the daemon. It needs the D-Bus policy installed first:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/install-dev.sh --systemd  # policy, polkit, unit, and start it
fw-helperctl status                      # unprivileged, via D-Bus
fw-helperctl profile                     # quiet | balanced | performance
fw-helperctl watch 10                    # live power, fan, CPU temp at 1 Hz
```

Package power needs a **root daemon** — `energy_uj` is `0400`, the PLATYPUS mitigation. The
client stays unprivileged and holds no hardware access. Without the daemon, `fw-helperctl`
falls back to reading sysfs directly and everything except package power still works.
Nothing in `fw-helperctl` writes to hardware.

Tests need neither hardware nor root; they run against synthetic sysfs fixtures:

```bash
cargo test --all
```

## Poking at your own machine

```bash
./scripts/fw-probe.sh                    # read-only survey
sudo ./scripts/fw-probe.sh --write-test  # also tests whether writes are honoured
```

`--write-test` briefly changes power limits and fan duty, then restores them. It only ever
spins the fan *up*. Read it before running it.
