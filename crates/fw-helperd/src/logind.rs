//! logind integration: suspend and resume.
//!
//! Two jobs, and the second one is safety-critical.
//!
//! 1. The energy counter cannot be trusted across suspend — it may reset while
//!    wall-clock advances, so any delta spanning the gap is meaningless (ADR 0009).
//! 2. **The fan must be back under EC control before the machine suspends**
//!    (ADR 0006 point 2). Manual control is a lease held by a running process, and a
//!    suspended process is not minding anything: the watchdog thread is frozen too, so
//!    for the whole duration of the sleep there is nothing between the fan and
//!    whatever duty it was left at.
//!
//! The signal alone is not enough for job 2. `PrepareForSleep(true)` is a
//! notification, not a request for permission — logind does not wait for handlers. So
//! we hold a **delay inhibitor lock**, which is what actually buys the time to write
//! `pwm1_enable=2` before the machine goes down. The lock is a file descriptor: it is
//! held by holding it, and released by dropping it, which is why the drop below is
//! deliberately the last thing that happens.
