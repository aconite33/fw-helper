//! `fw-helperd` — privileged daemon for fw-helper.
//!
//! Owns all hardware access; the GUI and CLI hold none and reach it over D-Bus
//! (ADR 0003). Writes arrived with M2 (charge limit) and M3 (fan).
//!
//! Manual fan control is the one thing here that can damage the machine, so the
//! shutdown paths are not boilerplate: every route out of this process must return
//! `pwm1_enable=2` (ADR 0006). Clean exit, `SIGTERM`, `SIGINT` and panic are covered
//! below; `SIGKILL` and a hung process are not, and are covered by `ExecStopPost` and
//! the watchdog respectively. The watchdog's heartbeat is the telemetry poll loop, so
//! the thing that proves this daemon is alive is the same thing that proves it is
//! doing its job.
