//! The firmware floor: never quieter than the EC would be.
//!
//! ADR 0006 point 4. A user-authored curve may only ever be *more* aggressive than
//! firmware, which bounds the damage from a badly drawn curve to "louder than
//! necessary" — an annoyance rather than a thermal event. This is what makes it
//! defensible to expose curve editing at all.
//!
//! **Firmware's duty can be read directly.** While `pwm1_enable=2`, `pwm1` reports the
//! duty the EC has chosen — confirmed 2026-08-21 across 60 samples, whose RPM matched
//! the measured duty→RPM table to within 2.5% on average. So the floor is *observed*,
//! not modelled: [`FirmwareFloor::observe`] records what firmware actually did at each
//! temperature, and that is what the floor returns.
//!
//! The two measured tables below remain only as the **cold start**, for temperatures
//! nothing has been seen at yet. Composing them (temperature→RPM, then RPM→duty) was
//! the original mechanism and it carries the interpolation error of both; a direct
//! observation always beats it and always wins.
//!
//! **Only observations taken while the temperature is rising or steady are recorded.**
//! The EC has enormous hysteresis — measured, at 61.9 °C it runs duty 0 on the way up
//! and duty 92 on the way down, and it does not stop the fan until below 44.9 °C. The
//! descending branch is not firmware's answer to "what does this temperature need"; it
//! is firmware avoiding oscillation while shedding heat. Recording it would ratchet the
//! floor up to a duty firmware only uses on the way down, and would make a silent idle
//! impossible for ten minutes after any load.
//!
//! Two honesty notes about the tables:
//!
//! - The duty→RPM curve is **concave**, and badly approximated by a line. A linear fit
//!   through the three high points measured first predicted duty 77 for 2925 rpm; the
//!   real answer is ~85. Extrapolation here errs quiet, which is the dangerous
//!   direction, so the table is used directly and interpolated only between measured
//!   points.
//! - The EC table has **four points and a large gap across the knee** (44.9 °C to
//!   53.9 °C, over which it goes from silent to 2020 rpm), and worse, those points come
//!   from measurements taken under sustained load — the *descending* branch. Measured
//!   later while heating, firmware runs the fan at 0 rpm at both 53.9 °C and 64.8 °C.
//!   So the table is not just sparse, it describes the wrong branch. It survives only
//!   as a cold start, and any observation supersedes it.

/// Below this the fan does not turn at all: duty 20 measured 0 rpm, duty 30 measured

/// predicts ~2886, and where the EC itself runs 2925 rpm at 64.8 °C. The table is
