//! Manual fan control — acquired as a lease, never held as a state.
//!
//! Once `pwm1_enable=1` the EC stops managing the fan and holds whatever duty was
//! last written, **indefinitely**. The failure is asymmetric: a daemon that dies at a
//! high duty leaves the machine loud, which is harmless; one that dies at a low duty
//! leaves the fan low under load, which is not, and which is inaudible by definition.
//! ADR 0006 therefore treats manual control as something acquired deliberately and
//! released on every exit path, including the ones nobody plans for.
//!
//! This module is the *mechanism* only. The curve engine, the watchdog, the
//! firmware-floor clamp and the `temp*_crit` ceiling all sit on top of it and are
//! what make manual control safe to expose to a user. Nothing here should be driven
//! from a control loop until those exist.
//!
//! Three details are load-bearing, and two of them were corrected by hardware rather
//! than reasoned out in advance:
//!
//! - **Any failure mid-acquisition releases.** Returning an error while manual control
//!   is still held, at a duty we failed to verify, is the exact state this module
//!   exists to prevent.
//! - **The takeover window cannot be closed from here.** Baseline Q4 took control by
//!   writing `pwm1_enable=1` while `pwm1` read `0`, and the obvious fix is to write the
//!   duty first. It does not work: measured on 2026-08-21, writing `pwm1` while the EC
//!   owns the fan fails with `EOPNOTSUPP`. So there is an unavoidable window between the
//!   mode switch and the first duty write during which the EC holds whatever it was
//!   already doing. The mitigation is that the window is microseconds of a single
//!   function and the very next statement establishes the duty — not that it is absent.
//!   The pre-write is kept because it is free and harmless where it *is* supported.
//! - **Duty read-back is quantized, so verification is not equality.** The EC stores
//!   duty as a whole percent: write 180 and it reports 181 (180/255 = 70.6% → 71% →
//!   181). A strict read-back check — correct for the charge limit in M2 — rejects a
//!   write the hardware accepted perfectly well. See [`DUTY_TOLERANCE`].
