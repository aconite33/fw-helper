//! Framework's custom EC charge-limit command, expressed as bytes.
//!
//! Encoding and decoding only — no I/O. The transport is an `ioctl` on
//! `/dev/cros_ec`, which needs libc and therefore lives in the daemon (ADR 0010).
//! Keeping the wire format here means the fiddly part — which is the byte *order* —
//! is unit-tested with no hardware and no root.
//!
//! Why this exists at all: the standard CrOS EC charge command is present on this
//! board and does nothing, because Framework's EC also implements a custom one that
//! overrides it. Measured 2026-08-26 with the standard threshold at 80%, this command
//! reported `max=100 min=0` — two independent limits, and this is the one that
//! governs. See ADR 0012, and the Outcome section of ADR 0008 for what it replaces.
//!
//! Definitions verified against `FrameworkComputer/framework-system`,
//! `framework_lib/src/chromium_ec/{command,commands}.rs` — not from memory. An earlier
//! lookup produced `0x3E07` for the command id, which is wrong.
