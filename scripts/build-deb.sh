Description: Firmware control for Framework laptops
 Fan curves, sustained power limits, battery charge limit and performance
 profiles for the Framework Laptop 13 on Ubuntu, in one application.
 .
 Profiles are layered over power-profiles-daemon rather than replacing it, so
 the GNOME power slider keeps working and stays in sync.
 .
 Manual fan control is never taken without being asked, and is bounded by the
 firmware's own behaviour: the fan is never run slower than the EC would run it,
 and control is handed back on exit, on crash, on suspend, and if the daemon
 stops responding.
